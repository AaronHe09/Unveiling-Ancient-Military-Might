Often deployed to support the weaker left flank in battle, their role became one of misdirection and waylaying, while the traditionally stronger right flank would break the opposing line.'),
      ('Pike Infantry', 'Thorax Pikemen', 'Pike', 'Mail', 'Historically, the Macedonian phalanx innovated the use of the fearsome sarissa: a pike of up to 21 feet in length. First introduced to the army by Alexander the Great’s father, Phillip II, the sarissa was cumbersome but created an almost impregnable phalanx formation. Presenting a wall of pikes from five files of men, it protected more of the front ranks and created a much bigger killing zone than the traditional hoplite phalanx. Defensively, the Macedonian phalanx could not only withstand and repel any cavalry or infantry charge to the front, it could also deflect incoming arrows, as the back rows kept their pikes vertical until needed. Arrows were caught up in the raised pikes and fell harmlessly to the ground, where they could be repurposed by the deadly Cretan archers fielded to support the pikes. Thusly, the Macedonian attack, whilst slow-moving, could also be unstoppable: if coordinated and disciplined, it simply steamrollered its enemies from the field. Following his untimely death, the ''Diadochi'' - Alexander''s ''Successors'' - continued to use and further refine pike phalanx combat.'),
      ('Melee Cavalry', 'Companion Cavalry', 'Lance', 'Bronze', 'Macedonian Companion cavalry, known in Greek as the hetairoi, were the foremost shock troops of their age. Originally formed from the Macedonian nobility, esteemed friends and companions of their kings, these elite horsemen evolved under Philip II and Alexander the Great into a highly disciplined and formidable force with the adoption of the wedge formation that increased not only their manoeuvrability, but also their impact. Eventually their numbers were extended to include not just nobles, but in fact anyone who had been a friend to the king. Early Greek cavalry had been limited to skirmishing scouts and archers, as square formations of heavy cavalry up until this point were difficult to direct and wheel. However, the adoption of the wedge formation enabled the companions to exploit weak points or break the flanks of enemy infantry with precision. To achieve this they were armed with the ''xyston'', a fearsome double-ended lance, designed to counter-balance itself and be reversible should one end break, plus a straight sword or curved kopis for close-quarters fighting. Armour took the form of a shaped bronze corselet, with optional greaves, and an open Boeotian helmet, which afforded some protection without hampering vision. The horse itself was unarmoured. The rider sat on a blanket, as neither saddle nor stirrups were used at this time.'),

Mothers were honoured due to their essential role in producing its male warriors. Also, unusually for the time, marriage dowries were espoused in favour of matches based on personality and physique, rather than property and wealth. This was because the physical fitness of parents was considered paramount in assuring the health of their offspring. Spartan women were, like men, trained for physical agility from a young age, and married later in life as a result. Furthermore, wives did not perform domestic chores, instead dedicating themselves to training, childbearing and supervision of the enslaved Helots, who did all the physical labour at home and on the land. As up to half the male population were away fighting at any one time, this supervision was not limited to the household and fields; women had an active role in the day-to-day running of the city too.'),

After harassing the enemy by flinging javelins, they would hastily retreat before any counter-charge or flanking move could be carried out. As armies developed and tactics became more complex, peltasts were expected to take part in hand-to-hand combat: with such expectation they were given stiffened linen cuirasses and short swords.

Barracked just outside Rome, the praetorians were charged with keeping order during all public events.

Usually affiliated to their old commander or re-enlisting at the bequest of a particular Consul in times of need, veterans were afforded great respect and honour because of their previous service. As examples to the common soldier, they were often immediately promoted to centurion and given a pay rise. Crucially, veterans were exempt from the mundane and laborious tasks of legionary life such as digging latrines, building roads or making camp. During the civil war all sides called on old soldiers to swell their ranks and provide much needed experience, Pompey persuading a large number of evocati to join him against Julius Caesar by promising them promotion and more money to return.

This was due to the independence that the Sabaean kingdom maintained from the 8th century BC to AD275. This record was based on military might as well as diplomacy and the spice trade including frankincense and myrrh.

Dacian lands were centred around the Carpathian Mountains but, unlike their Thracian neighbours, they seldom got involved in the conflicts of others. The Dacians fought almost entirely on foot, and usually looked to their Sarmatian allies when serious cavalry were needed. Many Dacian infantry fought as peltasts, equipped with javelins, short swords and oval shields, but they also fielded archers. However, the Dacians were most feared because of a weapon called the ''falx'', which they used with deadly, limb-lopping skill. A two-handed sword with a forward-curving blade, a falx could cut a man in two from the top of his head to his breastbone. This weapon was so effective that the Romans improved their legionary armour to cope with it. The brow-ridge on later legionary helmets was there to stop a blow from a falx. Rome’s eventual victory in the Dacian Wars (AD101-106), celebrated by Trajan’s Column, finally dealt with the warlike Dacian tribes once and for all.'),

Firing bronze-tipped arrows from their heavy self bows, Cretan archers tended to carry shields, indicative of some additional prowess in melee, which must’ve made them an even more enticing proposition for a general hiring mercenaries for campaign. Their finest hours came when Alexander the Great hired Cretans directly into his army to support its unbeatable phalanx. Commanded by Clearchus, 500 Cretans accompanied the Macedonian phalanx into battle at Granicus, off-setting the Persians'' numerical superiority on the day and enabling Alexander’s subsequent victory. Whereas the Romans didn’t traditionally use archers in their forces, once they conquered Greece Cretan archers began to appear as auxiliary troops in their armies. Notably, they fought in Caesar’s campaign in Gaul against Vercingetorix, causing him to rally the best archers the tribes could provide to range against them.'),
      ('Missile Infantry', 'Auxiliary Peltasts', 'Javelin', 'Spolas', 'These skirmishers were named for their small crescent-shaped leather or wicker shields or ''peltai''. It was a common habit to name troops for their shield style in the Greek world. They wore little or no armour and carried three javelins. After harassing the enemy by flinging javelins, they would hastily retreat before any counter-charge or flanking move could be carried out. As armies developed and tactics became more complex, peltasts were expected to take part in hand-to-hand combat: with such expectation they were given stiffened linen cuirasses and short swords. They were still expected to use javelins, but could then join in the close fighting. Eventually, peltasts even exchanged their characteristic shield for the heavier thureos. Their name and battlefield function remained unchanged.'),
      ('Missile Infantry', 'Auxiliary Rhodian Slingers', 'Slinger', 'Padded', 'Perhaps not as famous as their counterparts from the Balearics, Rhodian slingers were nevertheless famed for their skill. As Rhodes was protected by the sea, slingers could hire themselves out as mercenaries across the Mediterranean. They were deadly at 100 metres and could hit targets at 400 metres. Unencumbered by armour, they were highly mobile and could outpace or at least match the pace of most other infantry. Rhodian slingers sometimes made use of small shields with a single handgrip to protect them from any return fire. During the Greco-Persian Wars shaped shot gave the Greeks, including the Rhodians, an advantage over the Persians. This proved essential in covering the retreat of the Ten Thousand, after Cyrus the Younger’s death at the Battle of Cunaxa in 401BC. The Rhodian slingers were the only missile troops able to engage the enemy with some safety, as Cretan archers and Greek javelinmen had the same range as enemy missile troops.'),
      ('Missile Infantry', 'Leves', 'Javelin', 'Cloth', 'Under the early Roman army’s Camillan system, if you were poor or low born then you might well have found yourself in battle with little more than a spear in your hand. Typically the poorest members of a Roman Legion, leves were attached to the hastati and faced the full enemy onslaught. They were used as a screen and to skirmish with the enemy’s front line. Un able to afford much armour, the leves used javelins in support of their richer compatriots. Historically, there were 300 leves alongside 900 hastati: 20 leves in front of each of the 60 maniples. They were replaced by velites, who were deployed across the three main lines of a maniple.'),
      ('Missile Infantry', 'Velites', 'Javelin', 'Cloth', 'Recruited from amongst Rome''s poor and those too young to fight as hastati, the velites were the Roman army’s light infantry. They wore wolf skin head-dresses which are thought to have some totemic significance, although they were also worn to induce fear in their enemies. At the Battle of Zama in 202 BC, when Scipio Africanus confronted the Carthaginian general, Hannibal, it was the velites who helped fend off his initial elephant charge, utilising their light armour and weapons to move quickly around them. They harassed the elephants to a frenzy while the cavalry blew horns to disorientate the beasts. Hannibal had hoped to break the Roman lines with his elephants; instead, many of the frightened beasts turned on the Carthaginians. Those elephants who didn’t crash through their own lines were caught in a cleverly orchestrated manoeuvre, whereby the Romans carefully channelled them through gaps made in the cohorts'' formation.'),
      ('Spear Infantry', 'Auxiliary Hoplites', 'Hoplite Spear', 'Spolas', 'Hoplites date back to the wars between the Greek city-states in the 8th and 7th centuries BC. During the Greco-Persian Wars most hoplites wore a Corinthian-style bronze helm, and a cuirass of bronze or stiffened linen or canvas. They were armed with a short sword and an iron-tipped spear with a bronze counterbalance butt-spike. Hoplites were named, though, after the round hoplon shield they carried. The hoplon-and-spear combination required them to fight as a phalanx, a block of spearmen some eight ranks deep. When closed up, each man would find shelter behind the shield of his neighbour, creating a wall of bristling spear-points. While all hoplites were originally citizen-soldiers, full-time mercenaries took over and became the standard fighting unit of the Greek world. Later, under Phillip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great, the shield became smaller, while the spear developed into the five metre sarissa pike. Many armies adopted the phalanx of hoplites as a tactical unit because it was very successful in battle.'),
      ('Spear Infantry', 'Auxiliary Infantry', 'Spear', 'Mail', 'Auxiliaries supplemented the Legions of the late Republic and Principate and were recruited from non-citizens, usually provincial volunteers or from allied kingdoms. With the pressures of war requiring increasing numbers, especially in the aftermath of the Social War of 91-88BC, recruitment from Rome’s expanding provinces became a necessity. To limit the risk of rebellion, auxiliary units were recruited from a single province but always stationed far from home. Auxiliaries could be infantry, cavalry or specialists such as archers, and retained their own cultural identities and equipment. Being stationed in Roman provinces, under Roman rule, had an inevitable Romanising effect on auxiliaries, as did the rewards of service: land and citizenship. Some units eventually had ''Civium Romanorum'' as a title, meaning they were Roman citizens. From as early as Caesar’s Gallic campaigns auxiliaries accounted for nearly all Roman cavalry, and during the 2nd century AD auxiliary numbers actually exceeded those of the Legions.'),
      ('Spear Infantry', 'Auxiliary Parthian Spearmen', 'Spear', 'Cloth', 'These spearmen were drawn from the subjects of the eastern regions. They were inexpensive, and simply equipped with a spear, wicker shield and cloth armour. Their shields were oval or rectangular in shape with a central handgrip. While uniformly equipped for the most part, their appearance varied greatly depending where they were recruited, and all kinds of Greek and Persian influences were manifest. In battle, spearmen guarded the flanks of phalanxes, or provided protection for skirmishers and archers. Although ill-equipped to face heavy enemies, their numbers and spears made them an effective counter to unarmoured cavalry. They were also a common type of mercenary and levied unit throughout Asia Minor and the Middle East.'),
      ('Spear Infantry', 'Gladiator Spearmen', 'Spear', 'Varied', 'Gladiators were usually slaves, condemned criminals or prisoners of war but others did enter the arena. Those with debts or a lust for glory could sell themselves as gladiators, and soldiers who had given ground might be sent to the arena as punishment. A gladiator''s life was arduous and brutal, even before fighting in the games. Trainees could, and would, be killed in practice if they fought beneath their abilities, as a way of encouraging the others. The ludus, the training ground and home of gladiators, was run by a lanista, and within its walls his word was law. Outside the arena he was considered to be on the bottom rung of society; some Roman cemeteries did not allow the bodies of lanistas to be buried inside their walls, even. Having said that, there was also a peculiar glamour about their business and some were famed amongst games fans as the men who owned and trained gladiators - the sports stars of the Roman world.'),
      ('Spear Infantry', 'Spear Gladiatrices', 'Spear', 'Varied', 'There are no documented examples of female gladiators prior to Nero’s rule, but they are hinted at; in AD19, Tiberius passed the Larinum Decree, specifically forbidding daughters of those in high office from becoming gladiators. From Nero’s until the rule of Septimus Severus, who banned the practice outright, female gladiatorial contests became a regular feature of the circuses. Their existence wasn’t restricted to the Italian peninsula either; the Credenhill dig at Herefordshire in the United Kingdom unearthed a female skeleton bearing bone formation consistent with gladiatorial training. Gladiatrices were armed and armoured as their male counterparts: with swords or spears, shields, and if they could afford them, galea helmets and manica arm-guards.'),
      ('Spear Infantry', 'Rorarii', 'Spear', 'Cloth', '“Rem ad Triarios redisse” or “going to the Triarii” was a Latin saying meaning to fight to the bitter end. The veteran triarii were the third line of battle behind the hastati and principes, and only fought when defeat looked likely. However, this saying excludes the supernumerary ranks of the rorarii, who stood even behind the triarii and were, when deployed, the very, very last line of defence. There is much debate over their actual role because historical detail is limited but the rorarii were light infantry armed with spears and shields. They are likely to have been a skirmisher reserve, missile support for the heavier infantry or perhaps rushed to fill any gaps that appeared in the line of triarii. It is thought the rorarii came from the poorest Romans, and were young men of little experience. They may even have been a last remnant of the old Roman phalanx-style army. During the Second Punic War, the rorarii were replaced by velites.'),
      ('Spear Infantry', 'Triarii', 'Spear', 'Bronze', 'During the 4th century BC the Romans abandoned the phalanx in favour of armies consisting chiefly of hastati, principes and triarii. These were deployed in maniples: compact blocks of men, arranged in a checkerboard formation. This allowed flexibility when moving across the battlefield, particularly when compared to the sluggish movements of a solid pike phalanx. Like most sophisticated city-states of the ancient world, Rome expected its men to fight, and supply their own war gear when they did so. A cynical observer might be tempted to note that the manipular Legion also made sure that the hierarchy of Rome was preserved. The youngest and least wealthy became hastati, the first line of battle in a Roman Legion. Behind them came the second line of principes, older and richer men, and finally came the triarii, the most experienced warriors. “Going to the triarii” was a Roman saying that came to be used in all kinds of situations, implying that everything else had been tried and found wanting.'),
      ('Spear Infantry', 'Vigiles', 'Spear', 'Cloth', 'Vigiles were stationed around Rome and were responsible for dealing with any unrest that occurred after dark. Keeping the peace was just one part of their work as they also acted as Rome’s fire department. They were equipped with pumps to douse small fires, but a blaze could spread quickly through tight-packed streets, so often buildings were torn down to make fire breaks. Vigiles did this with impressive speed, and men were specially trained to remove roofs and knock down walls. In extreme cases they used onagers to knock down buildings in a matter of seconds.'),
      ('Melee Cavalry', 'Socii Equites', 'Spear', 'Chest', 'These equites were drawn from amongst the Socii, allied non-citizens who provided most of the early Republic''s cavalry. As there were typically two or three times the number of Socii than Roman cavalry, a consular army of two Legions could have some 1,800 Socii cavalry, of which at least 600 would be considered part of the elite equites extraordinarii. By tradition, Roman cavalry was habitually deployed on the right flank, while the Socii equites were sent to the left. This imbalance was famously exploited by Hannibal at the Battle of Cannae in 216BC, when the Carthaginian cavalry under Hasdrubal routed the weaker Roman cavalry while the crack Numidian light cavalry waylaid their Socii allies, such was the difference in troop quality. Following the Marian Reforms, and the Allied Wars of 90-88BC, the Socii were reduced to nothing; as full citizens they were absorbed by the regular Roman Legions.'),
      ('Melee Cavalry', 'Equites', 'Spear', 'Mail', 'Recruited from the gentry and lower aristocratic classes of Roman society, the equites were the cavalrymen of the royal and early Republican Roman armies. To be a member of the equestrian class meant that a man was rich enough to keep a horse, and provide his own armour, shield and spear. There were usually some 300 equites in each Republican Legion, organised into ten turmae of thirty horsemen each under the command of three decuriones. One of these men would be the praefectus, or commander, of the squadron. Mostly drawn from the young sons of elite society, these were men keen to show their courage. Showing prowess on the battlefield was an important step towards gaining political office and prestige for their families. Mundane duties such as patrol or reconnaissance would be the work of the equites extraordinarii of the Socii, the Romans’ collected Italian allies. During the Samnite and Punic Wars, the equites’ ranks were opened to first class commoners. Although they received none of the equestrians'' social and political powers, they eventually replaced the aristocracy in the ranks of the Roman cavalry, allowing the equestrians to become senior officers in the newer Marian Legions.'),
      ('Melee Cavalry', 'Legionary Cavalry', 'Spear', 'Mail', 'Developing throughout the Republic, from to the recruitment of allied horsemen from Iberia, Gaul, Numidia and Thrace, Roman legionary cavalry adapted to meet changing needs and resources. The cavalry of each Legion originally included 300 Equites and 600-900 Socii, giving a typical consular army of two Legions around 1,800-2,400 cavalry. During the Samnite, Pyrrhic, Punic and Jugurthine Wars, and with the demands of a growing empire, there was a gradual move away to using allied cavalry. As the equites became legionary officers and then the Socii became citizens, cavalry recruits from Italy became scarce: by the time of Caesar’s Gallic campaigns the Legions relied almost exclusively on allied cavalry. Equipment changed little during this period. The spear and chainmail adopted by the equites, probably influenced by the Celts, came full-circle with the recruitment of later Gallic cavalry. Helmet and shield styles did change and the small round shield of the equites became the versatile thureos.'),
      ('Melee Cavalry', 'Praetorian Cavalry', 'Spear', 'Mail', 'The word ''praetorian'' comes from the elite guards of the Praetor, the commanding general. Founded in the 6th century BC, the cohors praetoria consisted of the hand-picked infantry or cavalry who guarded their general and his command tent. At first, they were recruited exclusively from among Roman citizens, but later other Latin peoples were allowed to join. The praetorians enjoyed prestigious status in the Roman army and, when Augustus came to power, they were the only soldiers allowed inside Rome. Augustus anticipated that they could be used politically as well as militarily, something of a gamble for the new Emperor, as he was keen to assert the Republican nature of his regime. Barracked just outside Rome, the praetorians were charged with keeping order during all public events. Later, as the Imperial bodyguard, they served in military campaigns only when the Emperor himself was present. This happened frequently as later Emperors emerged from the ranks of the army during the 1st century AD.'),
      ('Melee Cavalry', 'Socii Equites Extraordinarii', 'Lance', 'Bronze', 'The equites extraordinarii were drawn from amongst the Socii, allied non-citizens who provided most of the early Republic''s cavalry. Up to a third of allied cavalry could be selected to join the equites extraordinarii. As there were typically two or three times the number of Socii than Roman cavalry, a consular army of two Legions could have some 1,800 Socii cavalry, of which at least 600 would be considered part of the elite equites extraordinarii.

      ('Missile Infantry', 'Gallic Hunters', 'Long Bow', 'Cloth', 'As far as the Celts were concerned, the best way to kill a man was in hand-to-hand combat. The Celts thought there was great value in personal bravery and there was no honour in killing from a distance. Even so, slingers, javelinmen and archers still had their place on the battlefield. It was often the only way that some Celts could go to war: Celtic warriors paid for their own equipment, so only the wealthy could afford, or had the right to carry, fine armour and weapons. Skirmishers were usually the poor: freemen who served as clients to the noble class. While they could never hope to achieve the same status as their noble masters, they could still prove their worth in the cut and thrust of battle.'),
      ('Missile Infantry', 'Celtic Youth', 'Javelin', 'Cloth', 'A Celtic tribesman reached manhood at fourteen years of age and, depending on his status, he could carry arms from then on. Nobles could also recruit their own following, building both reputation and influence through their clients, but proving their worth in battle was the start. Without bravery in a potential leader, no freeman would follow. A man''s future, if he lived, was therefore entirely dependent on his showing in battle, and this led to bravery being a commonplace occurrence. Like their elders, Celtic youths were not above goading their opponents with insults and taunts, and they used ''carnyx'' battle horns to instil fear in their foes. Inexperience, as with all young men, led them to sometimes act rashly where a little caution might have served them better.'),

In battle, they were not outmatched on an individual level by Romans or Greeks. Celts often favoured the spear in battle. It is a simple weapon, and a typical Celtic warrior might carry several into a fight: lighter javelins to hurl at the enemy on the approach or charge, and sometimes an iron-tipped spear for close combat. Some spears were crafted with barbed tips to cause further damage as they were pulled from wounds. Spears were also convenient for displaying trophies, in the shape of rotting enemy heads. This bloody appearance by the Celts, and a ferocious appetite for battle, was often enough to un-man opponents. Celtic warriors would send a chorus of chants, taunts and insults aimed towards foes, and blow their unearthly-sounding ''carnyx'' battle horns.

The two-handed longsword was first developed during the 8th century BC, but fell from favour before re-emerging around 450BC. It is possible that Celtic ironwork was significantly behind that of the Romans, as apparently their longswords bent very easily and had to be straightened against the ground.

However he also had the right to bear arms and fight alongside the nobles during times of war. In combat, a Celt could prove his worth, making a reputation for himself. This system caused an appetite for battle amongst the ambitious lower classes.
